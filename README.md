- Editing Linux files in Windows apps results in data corruption. [See blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/2016/11/17/do-not-change-linux-files-using-windows-apps-and-tools/).
- Node.js Network Interface ([#468](https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/468) _FIXED IN INSIDER_)
- NETLINK and ICMP ([#69](https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/69) _FIXED IN INSIDER_)
- INOTIFY filewatching ([#216](https://github.com/Microsoft/BashOnWindows/issues/216) _FIXED IN INSIDER_)
